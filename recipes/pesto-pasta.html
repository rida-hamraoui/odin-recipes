        <li><strong>Onion and oil:</strong> Cook the onion in olive oil until it's translucent.</li>

        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> This pesto pasta is simply seasoned with salt and pepper. </li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in pasta and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and transfer into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a frying pan over medium-low heat. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in pesto, salt, and pepper until warmed through.</li>
        <li>Add pesto mixture to hot pasta; stir in grated cheese and toss well to coat.</li>
